🚦 US Traffic Accidents Analysis Project
Department of Transportation (DOT) — Data Science Capstone
📄 Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of U.S. traffic accident data (2016–2023) to identify key factors contributing to accidents and propose actionable recommendations to enhance road safety.
Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Tableau, this analysis follows the CRISP-DM framework, covering every stage from data understanding to actionable business insights.
🎯 Objectives
Identify patterns and trends in large-scale traffic accident data.
Examine how time, location, and weather conditions influence accident frequency and severity.
Apply statistical methods to validate findings.
Create an interactive Tableau dashboard to communicate insights effectively.
Provide data-driven recommendations to help the DOT improve road safety.
🧩 Methodology (CRISP-DM Framework)
Step	Description
1. Business Understanding	Define the problem, stakeholders, and project goals for the DOT.
2. Data Understanding	Explore the dataset (7.7M rows × 46 columns) and assess quality, structure, and key attributes.
3. Data Preparation	Clean and preprocess data, handle missing values, format datetime fields, and create derived features such as hour, weekday, and weather grouping.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)	Visualize temporal, spatial, and environmental accident trends. Identify high-risk time periods, weather patterns, and regional hotspots.
5. Statistical Analysis	Use correlation, Chi-square, ANOVA, and T-tests to confirm relationships and validate findings.
6. Insights & Recommendations	Deliver clear, actionable insights that can guide policy and infrastructure improvements.
7. Dashboard & Communication	Create an interactive Tableau dashboard and summarize key findings for stakeholders.
🧮 Tools and Libraries

📊 Key Insights
Rush Hour Peaks:
Accidents occur most frequently between 7–9 AM and 4–6 PM, correlating with commuting times.
→ Suggests interventions such as staggered work schedules or adaptive traffic signals.
Weather Conditions:
Rain, snow, and fog are linked to higher severity accidents.
→ Recommends implementing dynamic weather alerts and improved road maintenance.
Geographic Concentration:
States such as California, Texas, and Florida show the highest accident rates.
→ Suggests prioritizing infrastructure investments and localized safety campaigns.
💡 Recommendations for the DOT
Deploy AI-driven traffic monitoring systems during peak hours.
Introduce weather-adaptive traffic management and dynamic road warnings.
Focus infrastructure improvement funds on high-risk areas.
Expand driver awareness campaigns in states with the highest accident frequency.
